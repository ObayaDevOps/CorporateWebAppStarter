# CorporateWebAppStarter
A NextJs/Strapi CMS Starting point for developing business websites

Based on : https://github.com/strapi/starters-and-templates/tree/main/packages/starters/next-corporate

This is a starter for a full web app.

NOTE: The backend must be up/deployed first as the front end reads (REST call) from the backend to know what to display.
